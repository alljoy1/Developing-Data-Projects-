Even before recorded history, the phases of the moon have played a significant role in people's lives.  Full moons in particular instill a feeling of mystery and foreboding.  Some examples from science and folklore:
- Madness - Full moons were believed to instill and heighten madness
- Werewolves - Belief of temporary human transformation into a vicious creature without human cognition or conscience 
- Extreme tides occur at new moon and full moon
- Many cultures based their astrological calendars on lunar

Fazed Lunacy is a site that predicts the full moon phases based on a mathematical formula calculated using the statistical programming language 'R'.  The use of this site provides several public safety benefits:

- Know when to take a romantic stroll in the moonlight or when to run away from tidal waves
- Take a holiday to the opposite hemisphere to see the moon upside-down (this provides the additional benefit of stimulating the travel and tourism industries)
